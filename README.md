# Self Balancing Robot
Balancing bot using arduino and MPU6050(KALMAN filter):
<br>
<ul>
<li>Designed a robot which can balance itself in vertical position on two wheels
based on PID algorithm using an <br>Atmel Atmega-328p microcontroller.</li>
<li>	Kalman filter(library) is used to remove noise collected from accelerometer and gyrometer of MPU6050 IMU sensor.</li>
</ul>
