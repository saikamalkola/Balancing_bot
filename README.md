# Self Balancing Robot
<br>
Balancing bot using arduino and MPU6050(KALMAN filter):
<br>•	Designed a robot which can balance itself in vertical position on two wheels
based on PID algorithm using an Atmel Atmega-328p microcontroller.
<br>•	Kalman filter(library) is used to remove noise collected from accelerometer and gyrometer of MPU6050 IMU sensor.
